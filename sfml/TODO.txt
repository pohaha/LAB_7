Ideas:
	Make tests as branches to not change my final code too much!

DONE:
	-override the draw function of shape.cpp to draw the outlining of a future figure, showcasing 
	its width and height
	-add sf::text for explaining a user what an outlining is(sf::text,sf::font with a scalable(
	depending on width and height of an object) size)
	-test the shape class


TODO: 
	-create ellyps and triangle classes 
	-override the draw functions and the setting up of their shapes;
